                    This one is a fun little time killer. As its name suggests, the website deals with the process of transformation you achieve when you start mixing different things. You start with Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. The goal is to create as many different materials or objects as possible. For example, earth and air will form dust. There are no rules just mix and match your creations to create new ones. You will not even know where your time went.

                        Vsauce is one of the few websites on the internet which makes learning fun and interesting. Whenever you have a little downtime and looking for ways to pass it, just head over to the website to learn interesting things and concepts such as the infinite money paradox, the game you win by losing, the napkin ring problem, and more. And if none of those things made any sense, you should definitely visit the website.

                        We all know how difficult finding a good movie to watch can be. It happens with me all the time and I always have to watch the same few movies over and over again. This website is a boon to people like me. They have a highly curated list of movies which you can select based on genre, mood, or just randomly. The best part about this website is that they highlight movies which for one reason or another could not appease the mass media, but are an excellent watch. I have discovered a lot more movies here than anywhere else.
